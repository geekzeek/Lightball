# Lightball
Arduino Implementation of a randomized pattern and color generator for WS2812B LEDs
- Capable of addressing any number of LEDs in a 2D Matrix, provided sufficient PWM pins are available
- Implements a method of incrementing random seed using time and fuzzy analog readings to ensure random patterns
